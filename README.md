Hello there!

This is a file that represents my time learning the Two Sum algorithm.
This repo includes my code-along file "two-sum-algorithm-lesson.js".
As I code along I like to write my thoughts as comments.

Reach out or comment if you have suggestions for how to make this even more informative/accurate!
